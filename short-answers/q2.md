# Question
What is the difference between `.then` and `.catch`? What are the similarities?

# Answer
The difference between `.then` and `.catch` is that they handle different results of promise. `.then` is used to handle fulfillment of a promise, meaning that it has been resolved whereas `.catch` is used when promises are rejected due to errors. But they are similiar in the fact that they are both callback functions that happen asynchronously. They can also return new promises for chaining purposes.
