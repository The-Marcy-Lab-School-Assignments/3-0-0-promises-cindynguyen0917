# Question
With `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, which of the following makes the promise produce a value?

a. calling `resolve()` or `reject()`

b. calling *and* returning them

# Answer
Option a where calling the functions are simply enough to make the promise produce a value because the value of a promise being resolved or rejected is dependent on the argument passed into `resolved()` or `reject()`.
